**** AFJ Sheet Edit - version 0.60b

I Large update this time. I have added a few new things as well as fixed (i hope) i big amount of bugs

Cut/Copy/Paste now works like it does in MS Excel 2003, this mean you cannot select multiple single cells, that aren't
next to each other and copy/cut them anymore.
Also the program now put a '0' in the last column if the column title is either 'eol' or '*eol'.
The grid now also supports font changes. You can change the font used in the Edit->Options dialog box, here you can also
se a new option: "Timed Backup". Enabling this optin will make a save og the current work into <path><filename>.tim. This
file will be deleted when you close the file.
The last thing added this time is a 'Close' function in the 'File' menu
Enjoy

**** Features not implemented yet
Print
Moving Cells

**** Operators
+	add and unary positive sign
-	subtract and unary negative sign
*	multiply
/	divide
^	square
%	modulus

**** Functions - 1 parameter only
Bare in mind that trigonometric functions take Radians as their input

cos		Cosine
acos		Arccosine
cosh		Hyperbolic Cosine
sin		Sine
asin		Arcsine
sinh		Hyperbolic Sine
tan		Tangent
atan		Arctangent
tanh		Hyperbolic Tangent
log		Logarithm based on 10
ln		Natuaral Logarithm
exp		Exponential
abs		Absolute
floor		Nearest Lowest
ceil		Nearest Highest
trunc		Remove fragtion eg. 2.234 = 2
round		Round up or down to integer eg 2.234 = 2 and 2.56 = 3
frag		Remove first part eg 2.234 = 0.234
sqrt		Square Root
rad		convert Degree to Radians
deg		Convert Radians to Degree
grad		Convert Degree to Grad
grad2deg	Convert Grad to Degree
and		Logical And
or		Logical Or
xor		Logical Xor
not		Logical Not


**** Functions - 2 or more parameters
atan2( y : x )	arctangent operation on y/x
pow( x : n )	does the same a ^ does
root( x : n )	take the n'th root of x
cell( y : x )	get value from cell


**** SFL and UFL instructions
If you want comments in the files use '#'

Basic function declraration:

	function_name[<parameter_count>] = <expression>

functions_name: 	the name you want the functions to be named
parameter_count: 	number of parameters in the expression. Must be at least 1 and no higher than 9
			Each parameter is name like arg<num> in the expression
expression: 		normal expression

Example:

	sum[2] = log(arg1) + log(arg2)

you would then call the function in a cell like this:

	=sum(3:4)	this would be the same as: =log(3)+log(4)

The '=' is to call the function parser from a cell. The ':' is the splitter for parameters
Each file have to end with at least an empty or commented line

**** 'Apply Function' menu
You can apply all the basic math and SFL UFL commands to all slected cells, using this menu.
Three Variables are supported currently:

$c = cell content (eg. take the value that the cell contains)
$x = col number
$y = row number

fx:
convert the cell values to their sinus equlivant and add 3 you do:

	sin($c)+3

if you want the cell just above instead you do:

	sin(cell($y-1:$x))+3

and a simple inc from above cell:

	cell($y-1:$x)+1

*************************************************************
Prior Releases:

0.551b

A small bugfix

Apparantly the "Fill Cells" function didn't work. Bug removed

0.55b
Just a small update.

Added the One Instance only option so people who doesn't like only one instance the program running can disable that.

Added Sheet Tab control, to keep track of what sheets you have open. Can be disabled from the options menu.

0.54b
Just a So, this time i have use almost a week on making the new version.  have beeing improving load and save speed, so it wont
take forever to load the animdata.tx created by Paul's animdata_edit tool. Also you can open i more than one time now.

A Shell Extension is also added this time. I have placed it in data\Extension along with two .bat files. The file
names should be easy enough to understand. Just remember you have to reboot to remove the Extension from memory, thou
it is not needed to reboot to disable it.

More fun: Drag and Drop is implemented. Now you can drag the files into you progam to open them. Also it is now possible to open more than one file at the command line.

Menu Functions: in the Math menu 3 new options is now added. Round and Trunc is two of them. they are working in the same way as the 'round' and 'trunc' commands does.
The third menu is the "Apply Function", now this is a strong menu function for applying whatever you need onto the cells. Look in the "Math Func" section below, to see what you can do.

Options: one small option. Backup Files is now numbered like this <orgfilename>-<number>.bak. lowest number is the most recent file. In the option dialog you can set how many backup files you want.

Last but not Least: Undo, yes that's right, I Finaly enabled it.
HOWEVER!!!! This only works if you edit the cells or select some cells and press 'Delete'. I have only enabled 10 levels
of this undo so if you make a change 11th times the 1st undo will be removed automaticly.
Expect more news on this in future versions, suggestions are welcome.

0.53b:
This is just a smal update to a few bugs that have been found. Thou a small search function is added
under the context menu.

0.52b:
Only a little over a week has gone this time before a new update.
This time it's mainly BUG killing time, so there isn't much to say, other than the "Cell Fxing" menu
have been moved from "edit" to "view" and has added Accelerators to them:

Alt + 1	=	Fix Collumn
Alt + 2 =	Fix Row

Another accelerator that I didn't mention before, mainly because I didn't know it was enabled:

Ctrl + Tab	Switch Txt Window

0.51b:
Okay it have been a few days, and i have already made some new updates. Someone stuffed some ideas into my head
and i just have to add them to the editor. There has been added a few things to options area:

Hide Top Row: hides the row with the letters (eg. A, B, C, etc.)
Don't Fix Column: Doesn't fix the 1st column when selecting "Fix Fist Column and Row"
Cell Width/Height & Font Size: The text says it all ;)

A new Menu is also added: Math
This menu makes it possible do the simplest math in multiple cell's a time

Added a few more Keyboard Shortcuts:
Ctrl + N 	= New
Ctrl + O	= Open
Ctrl + S 	= Save
Ctrl+ Shift + s = Save As...

0.50b:
So now I have decided to move to beta stage with the Sheet Editor. This forces me ofcourse to replace the
Search routine with a Search/Replace routine and i have got it to work just fine. The dialog now doesn't
close when you click "Find Next" it stays open but moves the marker to the text. "Replace" replaces the text
where the marker is at. The Repeat Seach Button functions like it did before.
A new toolbar has also entered the scene. It contains a Progress bar that show the file load. It also includes
an edit field where you can edit the text also. Every time you select a new Cell the text will also be placed
in this field. The green "V" sign is used when you enter text in the edit field. All marked cells will be
replaced with the text in the edit field.
Of other changes:
There's no need for the IniLoad.dll and SheetCfg.ini files anymore as i have moved all options to the Windows
Registry. In the Menu "Edit" you find an "Options" choise wich shows you an Option Dialog. Simply change the
options in here.

0.05a:
I have been lazy in tha last two months. Not a single update. But anyway here is the 0.05a version.
Mainly bug fixes.

0.04a:
Minor update. Clone row have been introduced this time. Also a fix for the search routines
should be in order now. There has also been space for a few new commands. New commands are marked
with a {NEW}

0.03a:
This new release have a few changes and most of all, a function parser.
each time you enter '=' as the first character in a cell, it will invoke the parser
basic +-/*^% is included as well as some basic math functions, like 'cos' and 'sin'.
Look at the bottom for a complete list of functions. What more is, there is also included
a SFL (Standard Function Library) and UFL (User Function Library). Both librarys is text
based files called sfl.dat and ufl.dat contained in the .\data dir. The SFL lib you should
not change as it is possible to change for each release. The UFL lib you can change as you
wish, since I have no intention to include UFL's in each release. If ufl.dat isn't in the
.\data dir, you can create it yourself
